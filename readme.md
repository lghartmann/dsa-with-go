I created this project to play with data structures and maybe publish this as a golang package, maybe someone finds it useful

i plan to adjust it to generics in the value fields of the lists.

usage of the program:

go run main.go "data_structure_here"

the options are: "linked_list" | "try" | "doubly_linked_list" (for now)
